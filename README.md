## Paul Kilgarriff

After working as a private tutor for the last half decade, I've jumped into the world of Software Development, and as a graduate of the [Makers Academy Software Engineering bootcamp](https://makers.tech/about-us/), I'm ready to leap into the world of tech!

During the course I've been lucky enough to work with many different people and try out loads of approaches to problem-solving - which has fuelled my desire to carry on taking on more complex challenges, and to make real-world impact with my skills.

With a background in education, it gives me great pleasure to share knowledge and to learn from others, and I always come away having learned more about myself in the process.

I don't want to ever stop learning and growing, and software engineering as a discipline both expects and rewards that. I'm driven by the idea of being better than I was yesterday, whether that's my own programming skills, my interactions with others, or just making a difference in the world through tech.

## Work Experience

**Academic Camp Limited** (2017 to 2021)
_Computer Science Teacher_

- Designed and ran 'Get Ready for Computer Science' course for four consecutive years
- Involved upskilling around 40 students
- Including both total beginners, and programming-language fluent students
- Preparing them to continue their education in Computer Science

**Academic Tutor Online** (2017 to 2022)
_Private Tutor (Specialising in Life Sciences)_

- Taught multiple students from KS2, through GCSE, A-Levels, and International Baccalaureate
- Subjects covered included English, Maths, ICT, Triple Science, as well as Chemistry and Biology which were my focus
- The sessions were run one-to-one, and so I developed my ability to cater to the individual, and avoid a one-size-fits-all style of teaching
- Outside of my duties as a tutor I restructured the Student Records interface, which required working extensively with Google Sheets and Google Apps Script

**Innovation Kinetics** (2010 to 2015) [Part-time] <br>
_IT Consultant_

- Communicating technical concepts to colleagues in non-technical roles was essential while working for this innovation consultancy firm

## Education

#### Makers Academy (January to May 2022)

- Delivered three engineering projects on different stacks, using short sprints to deliver a functional end-product
- Had my first experiences of working in an Agile team
- Worked with around twenty other students to solve various tasks - often using different styles pairing in order to generate high-quality results, while at the same time developing our communication skills
- Encountered principles such as Object Oriented Programming, the Model-View-Controller pattern for web applications, and the Single Responsibility principle to aid in writing clean, extensible code
- Carried out methodical processes to debug issues both with my own work and with others
- Worked extensively in JavaScript and Ruby
- Used Testing frameworks such as RSpec, Jest, and Mocha to test-drive the creation of programs in the above languages

#### University of Southampton (2009 to 2016)

- BMedSc (Hons) [Bachelor of Medical Sciences]

## Hobbies

- I have been involved in the Home Automation community for several years - up to this point it has been as a hobbyist, but I'm hoping that my new skills will allow me to make more meaningful contributions to the scene
- I am a fan of cinema, and am beginning work on a personal project that allows you to find which of your online subscriptions have films you want to stream
